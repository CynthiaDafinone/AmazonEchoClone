Submission for Sprint 2 of the Software Engineering Coursework

We have included an executable jar file which will run our program on required systems.
This jar file is located within the root directory of the submission (alongside this README)

All the project source code is included within the Software-Engineering folder within the zip, it also contains the resources needed to run the program.

The test programs we have so far are also included, and can be found within the same folder under the test_files directory.

We have removed student numbers from our submissions for a flat mark across the team.

The external libraries we previously used are now removed, and there should be no traces within the zip file.

To run the jar file on a linux machine: 
1) Navigate to the directory it is saved in
2) java -jar Software-Engineering.jar
